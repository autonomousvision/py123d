  **Experimental Dataset Support**

  TruckDrive support is currently experimental and may still change.
  If you run into issues, please open a bug report on
  `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/kesai-labs/py123d/issues>`_.

TruckDrive is a long-range autonomous highway driving dataset designed for heavy-truck safety,
perception, prediction, and planning research. It targets high-speed highway operation, where reliable
scene understanding hundreds of meters ahead is required for anticipatory planning and safe braking.

The py123d integration supports multi-camera and multi-lidar scene conversion, per-frame ego states,
3D bounding boxes (where available), and per-log lane-map objects.

For extensive details about the dataset contents, sensor setup, and companion tools,
refer to the official TruckDrive repository:

Download
~~~~~~~~

TruckDrive is distributed as a gated Hugging Face dataset.
After requesting access, export a token and download selected scenes with:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install py123d[hf]
  export HF_TOKEN=hf_...

  py123d-download dataset=truckdrive \
      'dataset.downloader.scenes=[scene_28_1]'

By default, the downloader fetches camera, lidar, poses, calibrations, and annotation archives
and extracts them into the expected on-disk layout.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parser itself is included in ``py123d``. Install the ``hf`` extra if you want to use
the built-in Hugging Face downloader:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install py123d[hf]


Conversion
~~~~~~~~~~

**Local mode** (already downloaded scenes):

.. code-block:: bash

  export TRUCKDRIVE_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/TruckDrive
  py123d-conversion dataset=truckdrive

  # Convert a custom scene list:
  py123d-conversion dataset=truckdrive \
      'dataset.parser.scene_names=[scene_28_1,scene_35_1]'


**Streaming mode** (download + convert in one run):

.. code-block:: bash

  export HF_TOKEN=hf_...
  py123d-conversion dataset=truckdrive-stream \
      'dataset.parser.scene_names=[scene_28_1]'

In streaming mode, scenes are downloaded to a managed temporary directory,
converted, then cleaned up.


Dataset Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``truckdrive_test`` scenes currently lack the ground-truth trajectory/annotations
  needed for full log conversion, so the current parser skips test logs in
  ``get_log_parsers()``.
- Sensor frequencies and annotation completeness can vary by scene; verify assumptions for downstream training/evaluation.

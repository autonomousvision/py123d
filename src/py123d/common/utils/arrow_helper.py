    # NOTE @DanielDauner: The number of memory maps that a process can have is limited by the
    # linux kernel parameter /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count (default: 65530 in most distributions).
    # Thus, we cache memory-mapped arrow tables with an LRU cache to avoid
    # hitting this limit, specifically since many scenes/routines access the same table.
    # During cache eviction, the functools implementation calls __del__ on the
    # evicted cache entry, which closes the memory map, if no other references to the table exist.
    # Thus it is beneficial to keep track of all references to the table, otherwise the memory map
    # will not be closed and the limit can still be hit.
    # Not fully satisfied with this solution. Please reach out if you have a better idea.
